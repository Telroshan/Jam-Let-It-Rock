## Context 
2nd edition of the internal Mistale Game Jam (follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MistaleStudio), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MistaleStudio/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mistalestudio/) btw !)

2 teams of 6 (3 artists, 3 devs) had 36 hours to create a game around the following theme : "Set it up, Let it go".

Let it Rock is one of those two games.

The other game is [The Perfect Recipe](https://twitter.com/MistaleStudio/status/1198904370940776448), a VR game in which you have to cook the right potion at the right time to defeat your enemies !

Made with [Unity](https://unity.com/).

## Rules
The first player that reaches 5 points wins the game.

When a player has an advantage of at least 2 points, a minigame occurs at the end of the round.
- [Smash](https://twitter.com/MistaleStudio/status/1198682211643482114) : smash the displayed input faster than your opponent to win this minigame !
- Don't press : if you press the displayed input, you lose. That's where the IRL fight begins...

## Controls
This game is only playable with 2 players, on gamepads.
